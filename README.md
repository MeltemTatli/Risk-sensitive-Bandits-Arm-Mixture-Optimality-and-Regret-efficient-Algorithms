We are providing the python codes as notebooks.
The libraries required are stated at the beginning of each notebook. You can select run all for each notebook.
Each notebook produces txt files.
RS-UCB-M-2_ARM —> RS-UCB-M algorithm for 2 arms RS-UCB-M-K_ARM —> RS-UCB-M algorithm for K arms RS-ETC-M —> RS-ETC-M algorithm for K arms
Uniform —> Uniform sampling algorithm for K arms
PLOT —> PLOT accepts txt files as inputs and parses the information and plots the experiments.
